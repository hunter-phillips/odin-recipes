    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When time is short or an oven isn't an option, cooking bacon in a microwave is a great solution! The bacon tastes
        just as crispy and delicious as any oven-cooked bacon.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Four slices of uncooked bacon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the bacon on a paper-towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Cover the plate with additional paper towels.</li>
        <li>Each microwave's power varies, so it is best to microwave on high and check after 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Depending on how crispy the bacon needs to be, add an minute and repeat until satisfied.</li>
    </ol>
